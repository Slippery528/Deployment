    <!-- Main content -->
    <p>
      We're more than just a daycare; we're a community dedicated to providing
      top-notch care and fun-filled days for your furry family members. Founded
      by Brett, a passionate dog lover and proud owner of Bolo, our daycare was
      born out of a genuine need for quality care for large breed dogs like
      Bolo. As a Rottweiler hailing from rich German bloodlines, Bolo faced
      challenges in finding daycare options that catered to his size and breed.
      Determined to provide a solution, Brett embarked on the journey of
      creating Bolos Doggy Daycare.

      Our mission is simple: to offer a safe, nurturing, and stimulating
      environment where dogs of all shapes and sizes can thrive. Whether your
      pup is here for a day of play, socialization, or overnight stays, rest
      assured they'll receive the same love and attention as Bolo himself.
